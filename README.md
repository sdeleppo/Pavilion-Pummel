# Pavilion-Pummel
Pavilion Pummel is a top-down shooter game which features rock stars fighting through alien hordes to take back the stage. This game was developed for a competition hosted by the NH Bank Pavilion, my team and I were tasked to create a video game based on their venue, which we won! This game was built using C#, Unity5, and followed Agile methodologies.
